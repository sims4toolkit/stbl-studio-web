          "answer": "All of your data is stored in your browser - it is not in the cloud or backed up in any way.

          "question": "Why was my translation erased?",
          "answer": "To optimize storage, STBL Studio does not store redundant translations. If another locale uses the exact same text as the primary locale, then it is stored as an empty string. When downloading that locale, empty strings will be populated with data from the primary locale."

          "answer": "JSON is a syntax based off of JavaScript that is used to store data. STBL Studio lets you import/export string tables in JSON format, since JSON is much more user-friendly if you would like to manually add, edit, remove, or reorder entries."

The value for the \"key\" property can either be a plain number, or a string containing an 8-digit hex number, with or without the \"0x\" prefix. This flexible format means that you can paste in the JSON content shown for string tables in S4S, the output of the <a href=\"https://frankkmods.com/#/ts4-tools/stbl-editor\" class=\"text-secondary underline hover:no-underline\" target=\"_blank\">old STBL editor</a>, or JSON representations of the <a href=\"https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/resources/StringTableResource\" class=\"text-secondary underline hover:no-underline\" target=\"_blank\">StringTableResource</a> in <a href=\"https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models\" class=\"text-secondary underline hover:no-underline\" target=\"_blank\">@s4tk/models</a>.",
