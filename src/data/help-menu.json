The UUID is generated by the <a class=\"text-secondary underline hover:no-underline\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid\" target=\"_blank\">uuid npm package</a>, and should produce unique identifiers for everyone.",

For now, you can either upload the STBLs you want to merge into a single project and download it, or you can create a project for one of the string tables and import the other one(s) into it. Alternatively, you can still use the <a href=\"https://frankkmods.com/#/ts4-tools/stbl-merger\" class=\"text-secondary underline hover:no-underline\" target=\"_blank\">existing STBL merger</a>, but keep in mind that that one does not support multiple locales at a time.",

          "answer": "All of your data is stored in your browser - it is not in the cloud or backed up in any way. Because of this, I highly recommended regularly backing up your entire workspace by downloading it with the <img class=\"inline-block svg h-4\" src=\"./assets/desktop-download.svg\" alt=\"Download\"/> button on the home page.",

          "kind": "questionAnswer",
          "question": "Why was my translation erased?",
          "answer": "To optimize storage, STBL Studio does not store redundant translations. If another locale uses the exact same text as the primary locale, then it is stored as an empty string. When downloading that locale, empty strings will be populated with data from the primary locale."

          "question": "What is JSON?",
          "answer": "JSON is a syntax based off of JavaScript that is used to store data. STBL Studio lets you import/export string tables in JSON format, since JSON is much more user-friendly if you would like to manually add, edit, remove, or reorder entries."

          "question": "Expected JSON Structure",
          "answer": "The JSON format this website uses is very flexible. The top-level structure must be an array that contains objects with two properties, one called \"key\" (case insensitive) and another called either \"value\" or \"string\" (also case insensitive). The value for the \"key\" property can either be a plain number, or a string containing an 8-digit hex number, with or without the \"0x\" prefix. This flexible format means that you can paste in the JSON content shown for string tables in S4S, the output of the <a href=\"https://frankkmods.com/#/ts4-tools/stbl-editor\" class=\"text-secondary underline hover:no-underline\" target=\"_blank\">old STBL editor</a>, or JSON representations of the <a href=\"https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/resources/StringTableResource\" class=\"text-secondary underline hover:no-underline\" target=\"_blank\">StringTableResource</a> in <a href=\"https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models\" class=\"text-secondary underline hover:no-underline\" target=\"_blank\">@s4tk/models</a>.",
