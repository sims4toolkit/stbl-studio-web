# stbl-studio-web

A web app for managing string tables for TS4 mods. Powered by [Sims 4 Toolkit](https://sims4toolkit.com/);

## Feature List

### Projects

A project is a collection of all of the strings for a particular mod, including all translations. As you add new strings to your primary locale (i.e. the one you write your strings in), they are automatically added to all locales, so you never have to worry about updating them again.

Note that you do not need to include all locales in a project in order to download them. You only have to add locales that you plan on tracking translations for.

### String Creation

Creating new strings is as simple as typing into a textbox - STBL Studio takes care of creating a unique key. It also has a token assistant, which lets you quickly copy any tokens you may need, as well as a new "prompt until cancel" option that lets you add new strings continuously, without requiring you to press a button or keybinding every time.

### Multiple Ways to Display/View

You can view your STBLs in a list, grid, JSON, or dedicated translate mode. You can customize how many entries up per page, as well as how they are sorted and filtered.

### Merging/Importing String Tables

Projects can only have one string table per locale, so uploading multiple string tables will cause them merge together. If uploading string tables for multiple locales, STBL Studio will determine which strings belong to the same entry based on their keys.

### Pronoun Batch Fixer

A tool that converts old-style pronouns into the new tokens is available in the tools menu.

### Other Stuff I'm Probably Forgetting About

I feel braindead right now and threw this together within like 10 seconds. I'll update it eventually.
