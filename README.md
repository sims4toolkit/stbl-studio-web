### Testing

To run unit tests once, run the command `npm run test:build` and then open the `test.html` file in a browser

To run unit tests while developing, run the command `npm run test:watch` and then use a live-reloading local server to host the `test.html` file ("Live Server" extension for VS Code is recommended). If you don't want to spin up a server, just open the `test.html` file like normal and refresh the page manually.
